    Will you hold the line
    When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
    In this house of mine
    Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
    Will the stars align?
    Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin, will it?
    'Cause this house of mine stands strong
    That's the price you pay
    Leave behind your heart and cast away
    Just another product of today
    Rather be the hunter than the prey
    And you're standing on the edge face up
    'Cause you're a natural
    A beating heart of stone
    You gotta be so cold
    To make it in this world
    Yeah, you're a natural
    Living your life cutthroat
    You gotta be so cold
    Yeah, you're a natural
    Will somebody
    Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
    What's happening?
    Looking through the glass, find the wrong within the past knowing
    Oh, we are the youth
    Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, face it
    A bit of the truth, the truth
    That's the price you pay
    Leave behind your heart and cast away
    Just another product of today
    Rather be the hunter than the prey
    And you're standing on the edge face up
    'Cause you're a natural
    A beating heart of stone
    You gotta be so cold
    To make it in this world
    Yeah, you're a natural
    Living your life cutthroat
    You gotta be so cold
    Yeah, you're a natural
    Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
    Took an oath by the blood on my hand, won't break it
    I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
    Gonna make it
    I'm gonna make it
    Natural
    A beating heart of stone
    You gotta be so cold
    To make it in this world
    Yeah, you're a natural
    Living your life cutthroat
    You gotta be so cold
    Yeah, you're a natural
    Natural
    Yeah, you're a natural
